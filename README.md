# tensorflow-crash

A basic example to get started with Tensorflow. 

This code and this repository was created for a tutorial to the fellows at the Insight Data Science program.


## Prerequisites

This code is Python 2.7 and relies on the following packages:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tensorflow

Please ensure these packages are installed before attempting to run the iPython notebooks. The script install_tf.sh will make the install via anaconda, but feel free to follow Tensorflow's documentation for different install options.
     https://www.tensorflow.org/install/


## Getting Started

There are several files in this repository:
- install_steps.txt describes how to install Tensorflow with Anaconda and points to resources with installation instructions
- data_generator.ipynb creates synthetic data in the shape of a donut. This data will be used as an example.
- donut_2000.ipynb and donut_20000.ipynb are example files created with data_generator.ipynb
- neural_net_example.ipynb contains several examples of neural networks for classification on the donut data.
- neural_net_bare.ipynb is the not-ran version of neural_net_example.ipynb
